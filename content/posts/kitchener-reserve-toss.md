### Summary:
While thermalling at a site and location that I am familiar with I experienced unexpected
turbulence. The glider collapsed. I was unable to recover the glider so I tossed the reserve and
crashed into the trees just below launch. Descent was complicated and delayed due to lack
of required equipment. However with the help of the other pilots present I was able to safely
descend. No injuries. Not even a scratch.

### Experience
Ten years. > 600 flights. > 200 hours

### Contributing factors:
- new site only a few dozen flights.
- a very dynamic site in general although there were no specific indications that this was any
stronger than other or day.
- I have had many asymmetrical and frontal collapses and a parachutal stall on one prior
occasion. However, I have never taken any professional SIV training.

### How could the incident have been prevented?
- possibly if I had more experience managing total collapse situations I may have had better and
faster reactions. This may have allowed me to control the glider and fly away safely. I am not
certain of this.
- Had I been flying a 1000’ further from the ground It would almost certainly have prevented
the incident. However, even in hindsight I still feel like I was flying on the cautious side of the
comfort zone given the conditions. I was simply unable to recover the glider within the normal
required time.

### What would I do differently if I could go back in time.
- I would take SIV training. Every year if possible
- I would fly with a winching line or a descent line.
- I would fly with an ATC or figure 8
- I would fly with a second static line and carabiners for redundant safety
- I would always have a 55m 9.5mm climbing rope in the car

### Detailed Description of the incident
Launch conditions: light and variable... predominantly east but occasional steady straight
in cycles. No sign of strong wind. A few birds climbed pass launch but I saw no signs of
extraordinary conditions.
Launch: nothing extraordinary. I flew straight out into steady lift at perhaps 2 m/s. I flew straight
through it to get away from the hill and trees before turning to seek lift.

Flight: I spent the next 10 minutes well out from the ridge about 300’ above the trees doing
ridge thermalling s-turns back and forth through slightly punchy but consistent lift. I have flown
in this very region several times before in identical conditions. I have flown at other times in
very much more raucous conditions without incident.
Collapse: without warning (at least none I observed) I lost 30%-40% of the glider on the right
side - away from the hill. I don’t understand it but if my memory is correct I was turning left
toward the hill. I know it makes no sense. I weight shifted to my right... and ensured I was
hands up on the left... maybe a mistake since it was the right side was closed but I felt I needed
to steer away from the hill. It was only a second or two before I started banking right and the
right tip opened Almost simultaneously the the entire glider was gone. At the time it felt like
the left side collapsed at the same time as the right side was opening. Up on reflection I think
maybe it was a full frontal collapse that happened just at the right side was opening. The glider
disappeared behind me and started bucking. My inputs had no effect. I concluded I had entered
a parachutal stall. I went both hands up to let it fly and check my altitude. I was heading away
from the hill so I was gaining ground clearance quickly but probably only back to 300’ The
glider did fly again. It shot way out in front as expected. I applied lots of brake to correct the
surge which worked fine. As I fell back under the glider I wound up with a 180 degree riser twist.
Looking up, the glider was again not fully inflated. And I had lost 1⁄2 my ground clearance again.
I was now flying facing the hill with a riser twist and the trees appeared far too close. I was
still not in control of the glider so I decided I need to be prepared to throw the reserve. With
my hand on the reserve I waited... probably only a second or two.. hoping the glider would
open and fly straight. The glider did not open so I threw the reserve. I probably did a poor job
of throwing the reserve as it was falling beside me. I began to reach for the bridal to yank it
open when I heard another thwak and became aware that the glider was now open and flying
fine. The riser twist snapped out and with a deep sigh or resignation I looked back to watch
the reserve inflate and swing up overhead beside my now fully functional but utterly useless
main canopy. With both the glider and the reserve open I began pulling in lines on the glider to
disable it. I got about 3 hand-fulls of lines in before I looked away to see the tops of the tallest
trees passing me as I entered the forest canopy.
The main glider hung up very near the top of a very tall Douglas fir. When I came to rest I was
about 80’-100’ from the ground and 3 feet from the trunk of the tree. I fly with a length of 5mm
static cord and a spare carabiner with which I secured myself to the trunk of the tree. I detached
one riser which was slack. I could not release my weight from the other riser enough to detach
it from the carabiner so I cut the lines. Now free from the glider I moved to a large branch sitting
near the trunk and got on the radio to let everyone know I was OK.
I spent the next 45 minutes or so gradually improving my position taking every precaution to
safely move down limb by limb always secured by my static line around the trunk. I descended
about 25’ this way until I reach the lowest limb to which I could safely lower.
At about that time a pilot arrived at the base of the tree with a 15’ piece of rope and another
section about 50’-60’ long. It is recommended to fly with a length of cord that can be lowered
to the ground in order to winch up a stronger rope. I fly a small alpine hiking harness and do

not have room for 150’ of 5mm static cord. It was a conscious decision years ago to fly with the
safety cord and carabiner but not the winching line. I do fly with a knife though and I began
cutting the lines off my reserve chute in order to assemble a winching line. I lifted the two ropes
to my station. The longer rope would not quite reach the ground so I rigged the shorter rope
to rappel a further 10’ down the tree to the next large limb. There I secured myself once again
and rigged the longer rope for rappel. From this - the last limb in the tree- the longer rope just
reached the ground. I descended both ropes via a Munter hitch through both glider carabiners.
I maintained my static safety line around the trunk as a backup until I was clearly past all the
tree limbs and the rappel line and Munter hitch were clearly secure. I rappelled the 50’-60’
length of rope to the ground.
After a ten minute hike back up the hill we arrived back at the car.
### Total duration a little over three hours.
